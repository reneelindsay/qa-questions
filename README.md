## Questions to consider when designing, implementing, and maintaining QA tests

The above text file is an evolving list of questions and answers regarding the process of Quality Assurance testing, what strategies and planning to keep in mind when writing and implementing tests, and how to ensure efficiency and thoroughness in the testing process.

The initial commit is inspired by a list of questions and answers from [Toptal.com](https://www.toptal.com/qa/interview-questions). Other resources, as well as my own contributions, appear as the list grows and evolves.
